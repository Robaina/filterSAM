    "# Filtering sam/bam files by percent identity or percent of matched sequence\n",

    "Tools to filter alignments in SAM/BAM files by percent identity or percent of matched sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Percent identity is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$PI = 100 \\frac{N_m}{N_m + N_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N_m$ is the number of matches and $N_i$ is the number of mismatches.\n",

    "## NOTES\n",
    "\n",
    "BAM/SAM files must contain [MD tags](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/devnotes/wiki/The-MD-Tag-in-BAM-Files) to be able to filter by percent identity. Aligners such as [BWA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2705234/) add MD tags to each queried sequence in a BAM file. MD tags can also be generated with [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-calmd.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/)\n",
    "2. [Pysam](https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "```pip3 install filtersam```\n",
    "\n",
    "## TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make it command line callable\n",
    "2. Perhaps good idea (if possible) to add a specific tag to BAM/SAM containing computed percent identity\n",
    "3. Include several definitions of percent identity and/or let the user define one"
